# Wind Turbine Power Prediction and Predictive Maintenance

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing wind turbine power generation data to predict power output, detect anomalies, and forecast potential failures within the next 24 hours. Using a dataset of wind turbine metrics (e.g., active power, wind speed, wind direction), the project employs exploratory data analysis (EDA), anomaly detection, time-series analysis, and machine learning to support predictive maintenance and optimize turbine performance. The insights generated can be used to create a digital twin roadmap for real-time monitoring and maintenance scheduling, ultimately improving productivity and reducing costs.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 50,530 rows of wind turbine data at 10-minute intervals throughout 2018, with the following columns:
- *Date/Time*: Timestamp of the measurement (10-minute intervals).
- *LV ActivePower (kW)*: Power generated by the turbine.
- *Wind Speed (m/s)*: Wind speed at the turbine hub height.
- *Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh)*: Expected power output based on wind speed, as provided by the manufacturer.
- *Wind Direction (°)*: Wind direction at the turbine hub height.

## Project Structure
1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:
   - Analyzed distributions of wind speed, power output, and wind direction using histograms and boxplots.
   - Visualized power generation trends by wind direction, month, and hour of the day using bar plots.
   - Conducted time-series decomposition to assess seasonality (no hourly seasonality observed).

2. *Anomaly Detection*:
   - Used Isolation Forest (contamination=0.01) to detect anomalies in power production.
   - Identified 504 anomalies where the difference between actual and theoretical power was significantly high.
   - Visualized anomalies using scatter plots with Plotly, highlighting power differences over time.

3. *Feature Engineering*:
   - Extracted temporal features (e.g., Month, Hour) from Date/Time.
   - Created lag features (e.g., wind speed and power at 1, 6, 12, 24 hours prior) and rolling window features (e.g., 6-hour rolling mean of wind speed, rolling standard deviation of power).
   - Defined a target variable, Failure_Next_24H, to indicate if an anomaly occurs within the next 24 hours using rolling aggregation.

4. *Predictive Modeling*:
   - Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict failures within the next 24 hours.
   - Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets, ensuring temporal order.
   - Evaluated the model:
     - *Accuracy*: 97% (high due to class imbalance, as most readings are non-anomalous).
     - *Recall for anomalies*: 33% (indicating room for improvement in detecting failures).
     - *Feature Importance*: Power generated and wind speed were the most significant predictors.

5. *Visualization*:
   - Created interactive scatter plots with Plotly to visualize actual vs. predicted failures over time.
   - Generated bar plots for power generation by wind direction and hour of the day.

6. *Digital Twin Roadmap*:
   - Proposed a workflow for real-time monitoring and maintenance scheduling based on anomaly detection and failure prediction.
   - Suggested integrating predictive insights into a digital twin system to optimize productivity and reduce costs.

## Key Findings
- *Power Generation Patterns*: Power production varies significantly by wind direction and hour of the day, with lower output in certain directions (e.g., SE, N) and early morning hours.
- *Anomaly Detection*: Anomalies occur when the actual power deviates significantly from the theoretical power curve, often due to high wind speeds or operational issues.
- *Predictive Maintenance*: The Random Forest model achieved 97% accuracy but struggles with anomaly recall (33%), indicating the need for more sophisticated models or feature engineering.
- *Seasonality*: No hourly seasonality was observed in power production, as confirmed by time-series decomposition and autocorrelation analysis.

## Technologies Used
- *Python Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- *Machine Learning*: Isolation Forest (anomaly detection), Random Forest Classifier (failure prediction)
- *Time-Series Analysis*: STL decomposition, autocorrelation (ACF/PACF) plots

## Future Improvements
